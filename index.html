				<p class = "regular_text">Cassette tapes are made of a polyester type plastic film with a magnetic coating. The original magnetic material was based on gamma ferric oxide (Fe2O3). Circa 1970, 3M Company developed a cobalt volume-doping process combined with a double-coating technique to enhance overall tape output levels. This product was marketed as "High Energy" under its Scotch brand of recording tapes</p>

			<p class = "regular_text">Following its peak in the late 1980s, the market for cassettes dropped sharply in both Western Europe and North America. This decline was particularly noted when its sales were surpassed by those of CDs in the early 90s. By 1993, cassette player shipments had dropped by 7% and continued to plummet for years to come. In 2001, cassettes covered less than 5% of all music sold. Despite the fact that most U.S. music companies stopped making cassettes by the end of 2002, surprisingly blank cassette tapes are still being made and sold in some stores today.</p>
